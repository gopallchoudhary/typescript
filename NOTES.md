1.All ts codes are compiled into js
2.TS is a development tool (it is a wrapper around the javascript)
3.Types => number, string, boolean, null, undefined, void, array, object, tuples, ANY, never, unknown
4.Syntax => let variableName: type = value
5.Primitive => STRING, NUMBER & BOOLEAN
6.any => when ts cannot infer the value of any variable, it turns off the typechecking of the variable
7.we use any whenever we dont want any particualar value to have typechecking error
8.we use ANY just to convice typescript that particular line of code is okay
